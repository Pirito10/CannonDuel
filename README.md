# Cannon Duel
_Cannon Duel_ is an **Android Turn-Based Game** developed as part of the course "[Programaci√≥n de Sistemas Inteligentes](https://secretaria.uvigo.gal/docnet-nuevo/guia_docent/?centre=305&ensenyament=V05G301V01&assignatura=V05G301V01403&any_academic=2024_25)" in the Telecommunications Engineering Degree at the Universidad de Vigo (2024 - 2025).

## About The Project
This project implements a turn-based strategy game for Android, where players control tanks on a grid, aiming to destroy the opponent's tank through strategic shooting and movement. The system integrates key concepts of mobile development using [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) and [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/compose), with AI-driven gameplay using reinforcement learning techniques through [Chaquopy](https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/) to run Python scripts for intelligent behavior.

The project features:
- Turn-based strategy gameplay with grid-based movement.
- Single-player mode against an AI opponent.
- Two AI difficulty levels: a random AI that makes arbitrary moves and a Q-Learning AI that adapts and learns from previous games.
- Integration with Chaquopy to execute Python scripts within the Android app.
- User-friendly interface developed with Jetpack Compose.
- Easy-to-modify game parameters and AI behavior for testing and expansion.
